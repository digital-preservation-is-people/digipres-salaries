			<description><![CDATA[<p>The University of York (UoY) and Historic England (HE) are pleased to announce the availability of a fully funded Collaborative doctoral studentship from October 2021 under the AHRC’s Collaborative Doctoral Partnership Scheme.</p>
<p>Entitled ‘Informing our Heritage Future(s): Preserving our Digital Past(s)’ this project will explore one of the most pressing challenges facing the heritage sector: the consistent capture, selection and archiving of diverse digital data sets that ensure their future accessibility and interoperability by the public and historic environment stakeholders.</p>
<p>This project will be jointly supervised by Dr Kate Giles and Kieron Niven (UoY) and David Andrews and Simon Taylor (HE) and the student will be expected to spend time at both the University of York and Historic England as well as becoming part of the wider cohort of CDP funded students across the UK. The studentship can be studied either full or part-time.</p>
<p>The project will take as its focus the historic High Street, which is currently facing a period of unprecedented change as COVID accelerates long-term trends in retail and residential demand, and as developers and local authorities seek to support the sustainable development of this heritage asset to meet key challenges of economic and environmental sustainability, housing needs, and climate change.</p>
<p>Close attention will be paid to the formats of digital data sets generated by stakeholders with particular emphasis on new developments in complex digital data sources such as laser scanning and LIDAR and the capacity and potential of data management systems such as GIS and HBIM to support better sharing, accessibility and interoperability within and between relevant stakeholders, aligning with HE’s Heritage Information Access Strategy (HIAS).</p>
<p>Details on the studentship can be found at <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/postgraduate-study/research-postgrads/pgr-fees-funding/"></a><a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/postgraduate-study/research-postgrads/pgr-fees-funding/">https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/postgraduate-study/research-postgrads/pgr-fees-funding/</a> and <a href="https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership-cdp-studentship-informing-our-heritage-future-s-preserving-our-digital-past-s/?p132280"></a><a href="https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership-cdp-studentship-informing-our-heritage-future-s-preserving-our-digital-past-s/?p132280">https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership-cdp-studentship-informing-our-heritage-future-s-preserving-our-digital-past-s/?p132280</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><b>The Borthwick Institute</b></p>
<p>The Borthwick Institute was established in 1953 in St Anthony's Hall in York. Following an award of £4.415 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, it moved to purpose-built premises on the University campus in 2005. The Borthwick Institute is one of the largest and most important archive repositories in the North of England. The Borthwick is a public archive repository, providing public access to archives from the 11th to 21st centuries. We have a wide-ranging and demanding clientele, with equally wide- ranging research demands. We are the busiest archive in the higher education sector.</p>
<p>Within the University we:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>serve academic departments as a repository for primary research materials, including the University’s archive;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>guide students, researchers and staff in the use of those materials;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide records management services across the University;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Borthwick staff play a role in the wider archive, records management and historical sectors through membership of a range of professional bodies, from editorial positions in record-publishing societies, to advisory roles in national strategic organisations.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong></p>
<p>All organisations produce digital records, but the methodology for retaining them in the long term is often neglected. In the context of the University and its Records Management Policy, the long-term or permanent accessibility and viability of its digital research records, as well as records produced by management and administration, are needs that particularly need to be addressed. The preservation of digital assets - and in particular the preservation of websites and online resources - are critical issues we need to address.</p>
<p>The long-term preservation of digital archives presented to the University, and the preservation of archives in analogue format that can only be retained in digital format (such as recorded sound), are also pressing needs in a University with an active archive collecting policy. In addition, the digital cataloguing of digital and non-digital archives, the digitisation of non-digital objects (such as paper and parchment records and chapters or images in published books), and preservation of and access to these resources, all require critical digital expertise.</p>

			<title>AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Partnership (CDP) Studentship: Charity and Voluntary Sector Archives at Risk: Conceptualising and Contextualising a Neglected Archives Sector</title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>UCL and The National Archives are pleased to announce the availability of a fully funded Collaborative doctoral studentship from October 2021, under the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)&nbsp;<a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/skills/phdstudents/collaborative-doctoral-partnerships-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collaborative Doctoral Partnership Scheme</a>.</p>
<p>The project explores archives and records management practices across the UK voluntary sector. It will be jointly supervised by Dr Georgina Brewis and Professor Elizabeth Shepherd at UCL and Kathryn Preston and Tina Morton at The National Archives. The student will be expected to spend time at both UCL and The National Archives. They will also become part of the wider cohort of CDP funded students across the UK, with access to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ahrc-cdp.org/category/upcoming-training-opportunitues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDP Cohort Development events</a>.</p>
<p>The studentship can be studied either full or part-time.</p>
<p>It is important to us that our organisations are more diverse, so we encourage applications from people of all backgrounds and identities. We especially keen to hear from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds as they are currently underrepresented at this level in this area.</p>
<p>Students should have a Masters degree in a relevant subject OR be able to demonstrate equivalent experience in a professional setting, such as work in archives or the voluntary sector.</p>
<p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>
<p>The archives and records of charities and voluntary organisations constitute a neglected resource. They are sources of institutional identity and accountability, and can give access to personal and collective memories. In particular, voluntary organisations, campaigning bodies and community groups’ records preserve the histories of marginalised and disenfranchised individuals and communities whose voices can go unheard. This includes the UK’s BAME communities; LGBT+ individuals and groups; people with disabilities or ill health; as well as communities marginalised in myriad ways through poverty and other inequalities. High-profile inquiries into the history of public, corporate and charitable bodies have highlighted the evidential value of records. These archives help explain the significance of charities to society, past and present. However, without the legal protection afforded to&nbsp;government records, charity archives also lack the financial resources and support networks that protect other private archives. Records are retained by charities in varying states of preservation and access, few organisations have staff with records management/archive expertise and many collections remain invisible. Today, the voluntary sector faces the perfect storm: a major loss of income during the COVID-19 pandemic combined with unprecedented calls on organisations’ services. This is a timely and urgent project that draws on qualitative research with charity leaders to explore archives and records management practices across the voluntary sector. It will produce a practical action plan to address identified challenges, propose improvements to support infrastructure and contribute to TNA’s strategic vision for the archives sector.</p>

<p class="customHTML">The School of Social Sciences and Humanities are seeking to appoint a Research Associate to work with Dr Lise Jaillant, Senior Lecturer in Digital Humanities, on a project which engages with policy makers to improve&nbsp;the preservation, access and usability of born-digital archives.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Cambridge University Libraries are about to embark on an exciting five-year Digital Preservation Programme to establish the Cambridge University Libraries Digital Preservation Service.</p>
<p>Based at the main University Library, an exciting opportunity has come up for a Metadata Specialist on the Programme. This is a new role for the Library that is essential for delivering the digital preservation service and contributing to a wider Digital Transformation Programme, both of which will support the Library's vast and diverse collections of digital materials as well as digital materials held by other libraries and University bodies.</p>
<p>The Digital Preservation Programme is a first for the University Library. The scope of this work includes a cloud-native and open-source digital repository and digital preservation system to underpin activities that ensure current and ongoing access to digital materials, as well as the implementation of additional tools that provide capabilities for the deposit of digital materials as well as search, discovery, access, use, and re-use.</p>
<p>The digital preservation service will support digital collection materials from when they are acquired or created to when they are accessed, used, and re-used by readers, as well as the stages in between, to ensure that current and future users can access and use these materials of cultural and historic importance and of global significance. The Library's digital collection materials consist of digitised images created from print and physical artefacts, research publications and data, and born-digital archives, amongst others.</p>
<p>Based within the Digital Preservation team and working with the Head of Digital Preservation, the Metadata Specialist is a dedicated role which focuses on the metadata required to support the current and ongoing preservation and access of digital materials. This person will play an essential role in ensuring that metadata for digital collection materials exists within respective systems, in contributing to the creation of any new data models and schemas, as well as optimising and in enhancing new and existing processes around collection metadata for digital materials.</p>
<p>The Metadata Specialist will focus on the following activities within the Digital Preservation Programme:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Analysing and evaluating the existing flow of metadata for digital collection materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undertaking clean-up, transformation, optimisation and/or enrichment of metadata in library systems to:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>supporting new and existing collection management activities for digital materials.</p>
<p>increasing efficiency and use of metadata.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Informing how metadata for digital collection materials will be consumed by systems implemented within programme, as well as systems that will remain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting and supporting the use of metadata for digital collection materials in its creation, enrichment, analysis, as well as in the provision of management information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributing to the development of local metadata standards and policies, develop and implement workflows, and monitor compliance with agreed metadata standards.</p>
</li>

The objective of the CTDR Audit Group is to audit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca/en/trustworthy-digital-repository">CRKN Trustworthy Digital Repository</a>, based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The recommended practice of the Consultative Committee for Space and Data Systems Practices presented in “Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories” (CCSDS 652.0-M-1),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current and evolving digital preservation needs and expectations of CRKN members and other stakeholders, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other generally accepted digital preservation best practices within the documentary heritage space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CTDR Audit Group will conduct an audit and deliver a final report, including recommendations for remediation and improvement, to the PAC by June 2022. In the interim, the CTDR Audit Group will make recommendations to the PAC and the Board that support the ongoing development of the CRKN TDR.</p>
<p>Membership in the CTDR Audit Group will consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One (1) current member of the PAC, appointed by the PAC, to serve as Vice-Chair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One (1) member of the former Canadiana TDR Advisory Committee appointed by the PAC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between two (2) and four (4) individuals drawn from CRKN’s institutional or associate member institutions with expertise in metadata, digital preservation or digital standards certification reflecting, when possible, regional diversity and the diversity of CRKN membership (small, medium, and large institutions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One (1) or two (2) individual(s) drawn from CRKN's stakeholder community with expertise in digital preservation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One (1) individual from an institution with a focus on digital preservation from outside Canada.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once formed, the committee will elect a Chair from among its members, other than the Vice-Chair, who have indicated a willingness to serve in that role.

			<title>Vacancy for Research Data Specialist at the DCC</title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-research-data-specialist-dcc</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-research-data-specialist-dcc</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<h4>The work</h4>
<p>The research data specialist role in the DCC is one that is designed to allow people with a wide range of backgrounds, skills and pre-existing knowledge to engage in all of the DCC's areas of activity, all of which related to one or more of open science, FAIR data, research data management and reuse, and the curation of digital materials in general. The activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>international projects such as FAIR's FAIR, EOSCPilot and FAIR4Health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consultancy for research-performing organisations, policy-makers and others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the development and delivery of training;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>events such as IDCC, RDMF and the RDA Plenaries;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the delivery of services such as DMPonline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first instance, you'll be spending about 60% of your time on the&nbsp;<a href="https://fairsfair.eu/">FAIR's FAIR</a>&nbsp;project, a H2020-funded consortium in which the DCC is playing a major role and is engaged in activity in every work package. How the rest of your time is spent in our other areas of work will depend in part on your knowledge and areas of interest, and in part on what work we have in the pipeline. Consultancy and training in particular present very varied demands depending on the client we're dealing with and the particular requirements they have. What we can guarantee is that the work is varied as are the people you'll deal with. There's lots of scope to develop your knowledge and skills working with us.</p>
<h4>About you</h4>
<p>The formal job specification, like many do, lists a big range of essential and desirable skills. It is a product of a formal process of characterising roles that doesn't always produce a clear description that potentially good candidates can identify with. I'll try instead to describe more informally what really matters to us.</p>
<p>Your previous experience could come from a wide variety of settings. It might have been in research, or supporting research, or working in some other environment where creating, reusing and/or understanding data is important. It might be in the public or private sector, in an internally-facing role or an externally-facing one. Your qualifications and experience could be in the sciences, arts, humanities, engineering, medicine or any other relevant area. You will need to have experience of data management and reuse in some setting, and to have some understanding of the broader principles of open research and the FAIR data principles. You are unlikely to be an expert in everything we do - none of us are. But you will be keen to develop and broaden your expertise while working with us and be able to demonstrate the aptitude to do so. You won't lack opportunities to do this whilst working with us.</p>
<p>You will need to be flexible, as the balance of our work changes from year to year. This is not a role for someone with a narrow research interest who wants to pursue that to the exclusion of all else.</p>
<p>Finally, although you'll sometimes have to work independently, you need to be collaborative. That applies to work within the DCC team and with the many organisations and individuals we work with around the world. Should you be selected for interview, we'll almost certainly be asking you for examples of this and about your experiences, positive and negative.</p>
<h4>The context</h4>
<p>The DCC is a consortium with staff currently based at the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Your employer will be the University of Glasgow but for most practical purposes we operate as a single team across the two organisations. Almost all our work is collaborative, with partners around the world, and we have a diverse team that reflects that international outlook. Ideally you will already have experience of working in this way, but that isn't essential. What is essential is that you can demonstrate enthusiasm for, and understanding of, what such collaborative working implies. Once the restrictions required by the COVID-19 pandemic ease you can expect the role to require a significant element of international travel. Even without the travel, the international nature of the work means you'll need to be able to work flexibly to accomodate meetings and events taking place in time zones very different from the UK's, or your own home time zone.</p>
<p>Like many people, we've all been working remotely for nearly a year now and we don't expect that to change in the immediate future. Thus we won't be expecting the successful candidate to relocate to Glasgow in the first instance and we welcome applications wherever you hail from.</p>

<p>The first of these combines projects to enhance the Discovery experience at the British Library and provide a Research Repository Service, with our response to the AHRC’s Towards a National Collection Programme. Collectively these projects will enable a significant development in the researcher facing services provided by the British Library.</p>
<p>The Library Systems Transformation programme is an equally ambitious initiative which is delivering a new digital asset management and preservation system, will implement a new archive and manuscript cataloguing system and plan the long term future for how we manage the c. 250 million records that form our published collections.</p>
<p>Both programmes are well established and include a blend of live and pre-initiation projects.</p>
<p>The programme manager will operate between the Technology and Business teams responsible for the delivery across these programmes. They are responsible for ensuring timely delivery of all projects and managing all aspects of the programme (timeline, budget, risks etc.).</p>
<p>To succeed in this role, you will need significant project/programme management experience that should include delivering technology enabled business transformation.</p>
<p>As one of the world’s great libraries, our duty is to preserve the nation’s intellectual memory for the future and make it available to all for research, inspiration and enjoyment. At present we have well over 170 million items, in most known languages, with three million new items added every year. We have manuscripts, maps, newspapers, magazines, prints and drawings, music scores, and patents. We make our collections and programmes available to all. We operate the world’s largest document delivery service providing millions of items a year to customers all over the world. What matters to us is that we preserve the national memory and enable knowledge to be created both now and in the future by anyone, anywhere.</p>

Applications should be submitted by email not later than 0900 on Monday 11th January 2021. Shortlisted candidates should be available for interview on-line Week Commencing 18th January 2021.</p>
<p>This is an exciting opportunity to work in a high-profile and important role, delivering support in good practice for digital preservation in for an established DPC Member but with a remit across our entire global membership.</p>
<p>In December 2020 the DPC started a second phase of a major investment project that is helping the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) to identify and develop good practice and standards in digital preservation across the UK nuclear industry. This second phase builds on an initial project which assessed and documented requirements within the nuclear power sector. With the support of a grant from the NDA, we have created a new post that will support the delivery of these requirements and which will bring significant new support to Members across the Coalition.</p>
<p>You will be the project officer for a fixed-term project funded by the NDA to research and advise on good practice in digital preservation. Working in partnership with the NDA, embedded within the DPC team, and managed by the DPC’s Head of Good Practice and Standards, you will support the NDA to achieve documented goals for innovation and capability in digital preservation. These include preserving geospatial data, database preservation, EDRMS preservation, recovering data from portable media, defining designated communities, gathering requirements for solutions and assessing skills and capabilities. These goals are widely shared across the DPC, so your work will enhance the support offered to all DPC Members in these areas, documenting and codifying good practice across the community.</p>
<p>The post is available immediately and is offered on a full-time, fixed-term basis for an initial period of two years with a view to permanence thereafter. Recruitment will nominally be to the DPC offices in either Glasgow or York, though Covid 19 restrictions mean that the applicant will be required to work from home in the first instance. Consequently, applications are welcomed without limit to geography, though there is a requirement to attend meetings in standard UK office hours.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bridging the Digital Gap Programme: eight paid, 15-month technical traineeships in London and the South West </strong></p>
<p>The <em>Bridging the Digital Gap </em>programme aims to increase digital skills in archives by bringing new talent into the sector to create a more diverse and inclusive workforce. The National Archives is funding a traineeship at eight institutions in London and the South West, supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.</p>
<p>We are looking for eight talented technical people to use their skills, energy and digital confidence to help preserve history and find new ways for people to access and learn from that heritage.</p>
<p>Archives are collections of records in all media that provide us a wealth of information about people, places and institutions. Archives allow us to explore our collective and individual identities and have an impact across society. It is crucial that they are preserved to keep the past alive for future generations.</p>
<p>The archives of today are digital rather than on paper, and so this is an exciting time for people with technical skills to join the archives sector. Starting in January 2021, trainees will spend 15 months working on real-life projects, learning on the job and gaining valuable and rewarding work experience at their host institution. Trainees will also have access to specialist training and development workshops, covering digital capture, digital preservation, and digital access and engagement. Trainees will regularly meet up and share learning, either in person or online, while they develop key skills to prepare them for exciting careers in the heritage sector.</p>

			<title>Request for Information - Web Harvesting Service at the Library of Congress</title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-rfi-web-harvesting-service-loc</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-rfi-web-harvesting-service-loc</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to obtain capability statements and potential feedback for an upcoming Library of Congress (LOC) requirement. The solicitation is not expected until quarter 1 or quarter 2 of fiscal year 2021.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Library of Congress (Library) requires contract support to enable the systematic harvesting of content from the web based on instructions from Library staff, to provide temporary access to the content and required crawl reports for quality review, and to enable transfer of content to the Library for preservation and public access. Since 2000, the Library has collected and preserved harvested web content related to a variety of thematic web and event-based topics, such as the United States National Elections, Public Policy Topics, Congressional and Legislative Branch topics, and Web Comics. The web archives are an important component of the Library’s born digital collections.&nbsp; The harvesting of selected websites for the Library’s collections supports the Library’s strategic goal to acquire, preserve, and provide access to a universal collection of knowledge and the record of America’s creativity. Web harvesting services will result in the capture of web content to be added to the Library of Congress digital collections.</p>
<p>The scale and variability of collecting required is notable. The Library typically requires thousands of seeds crawled at varying frequencies (typically twice-daily for RSS feed content, and weekly, monthly, quarterly, twice-yearly, and yearly for other types of content) at any given time. Content targeted for archiving can be single documents (such as PDFs), entire websites (such as State.gov), specific domains or portions of websites focused on a particular topic, RSS feeds, or a variety of social media content (such as public Facebook pages for organizations or people, specific Twitter accounts, or entire YouTube channels). Content targeted for archiving is published in the United States and in multitude of other countries, with varying languages.</p>
<p>The Library’s web archives follow a permissions-based model, so careful curation occurs, and scoping instructions are provided to the Contractor by the Library with each seed list to ensure that content is captured by the contractor in accordance with the Library’s permissions approach.&nbsp;</p>

			<title>Request for Proposal from UNESCO for Digital Preservation Consultancy Services </title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/rfp-unesco-digipres-consultancy</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/rfp-unesco-digipres-consultancy</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Promoting Information preservation is one of the six priority areas of UNESCO's Information for All Programme (IFAP), which sees it as contributing to guaranteeing right and access to information (SDG 16) for present and future generations. Confronted with high risks of information lost, relentless technological progress and increased production of information in non-digital and digital forms, countries are challenged to adapt and ensure suitable preservation of those knowledge resources. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Supporting countries in addressing those challenges and raising awareness on the importance of information preservation are all part of UNESCO lines of intervention as exemplified, in 2015, by the adoption of a Recommendation concerning the preservation of, and access to, documentary heritage including in digital form. A major instrument of the Memory of the World (MoW) programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, participants at the IFAP Forum: “Knowledge Societies for Sustainable Development in Africa”, organized in Harare (Zimbabwe), highlighted not only the need for urgent policy and operational actions to ensure information preservation on the continent, but also the difficulties for advocating persuasively without data. In consequence, they called for the development of an Advocacy Toolkit on information preservation comprising of, among other things, indicators for monitoring and evaluating information preservation and a Model strategy for information preservation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is in this context that the UNESCO, through its Office in Dakar, launched mid 2019 an initiative to develop a set of Indicators to assess information preservation at country level called: Indicators of Information Preservation Sustainability (IIPS). In September 2019, experts from several countries in Africa, following workshop held in Dakar, proposed a preliminary set of indicators that now form the "draft zero" of the IIPS. Those initial indicators fall within five categories: Legal and regulatory framework, Institutional capacities, Conservation, Human resources, and Infrastructures and Technologies. Following that draft, and in line with recommendations from the workshop, UNESCO Dakar Office is now seeking for qualified experts to further the work towards formulation of a comprehensive and suitable set of indicators.</p>

<h4>About the role</h4>
<p>The British Library is home to the nation’s Sound Archive, an extraordinary collection of over 6.5 million recordings of speech, music, wildlife and the environment, from the 1880s to the present day. The vast majority of these recordings are held on physical media - tapes, discs, cassettes - in more than 40 different formats. As these items physically degrade and as the means of playing them disappear from production, the recordings on them must be preserved. Today, that means digitisation; creating and storing stable, digital files, accompanied by rich descriptive metadata.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015, the British Library launched its eight-year Save our Sounds programme, an ambitious initiative to help safeguard the national sound collection. A major part of this programme centres on digitisation of the Library’s collection, including (but not limited to) the five-year Unlocking our Sound Heritage project.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<div>
<div>
<div id="tabs">
<h4>About the Organisation</h4>
<p role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ui-id-1" aria-hidden="false">The Scientific Computing Department (SCD) has a programme of work in developing information technology tools, methods and services to support Open Science. This includes managing and publishing research data and research publications and other related research artefacts, in particular within the FAIR data guidelines. The programme has the ultimate aim of assisting the users of STFC’s facilities and programmes maximise their value and impact through the use and reuse of research data.</p>
<p role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ui-id-1" aria-hidden="false">SCD is working within European programmes to further this aim. In particular, the FREYA project is developing the infrastructure for persistent identifiers (PIDs) as a foundation of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). SCD leads this project, which is developing and deploying methods and tools to support the use of PIDs for research outputs, including publications, data and people.</p>
<p role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ui-id-1" aria-hidden="false">A particular aspect of this project is the cross-linking of research resources to produce a view on the relationships between research resources and their impact. SCD is working with STFC facilities to develop use cases for future service development.</p>
<h4 role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ui-id-1" aria-hidden="false">About the role</h4>
<p role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ui-id-1" aria-hidden="false">The main focus of the post is on design and development of tools and prototype integrated systems that will lay the ground for PID-based services satisfying the needs of STFC’s own use cases and more widely in Open Science. These systems would need to interact with existing systems such as STFC’s institutional repository ePubs as well as query external PID-based systems through APIs and access to metadata. The post will involve design and integration of such prototypes for presentation to STFC’s facilities and wider communities with interests in PIDs, and will involve close collaboration with other FREYA project partners in their own developments.</p>
<p role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ui-id-1" aria-hidden="false">Reporting to the FREYA project coordinator at STFC, requires a high level of autonomy and responsibility.&nbsp;You will be responsible for making sound technical decisions that balance the vision of the project with the realities of existing IT infrastructures, for leadership of particular tasks within the project and for writing up the work in a clear fashion in project deliverables intended for a wide audience.</p>
<p role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ui-id-1" aria-hidden="false">There is also a requirement for&nbsp;an in-depth appreciation of the context of the work (requirements and usage of PID systems as well as FAIR data/Open Science in general) to help inform the overall direction of the project in such areas as services, policy and sustainability. Interactions with senior people in the FREYA partners will be expected, as well as representing the project in forums such as the Research Data Alliance (RDA). Working in a collaborative project environment is required, including contributing to project deliverables, presenting at meetings or elsewhere, attending coordination calls, writing documentation, and participating in dissemination activities such as international conferences.</p>
<p role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ui-id-1" aria-hidden="false">National and international travel is required to work with project partners.</p>

<h4>Role Description</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The University of York is looking to appoint a Digital Preservation Archivist to manage the long-term or permanent accessibility and viability of the University’s digital research records, as well as records produced by management and administration. The long-term preservation of digital archives presented to the University, and the preservation of archives in analogue format that can only be retained in digital format (such as recorded sound), are also pressing needs in a University with an active archive collecting policy. In addition, the digital cataloguing of digital and non-digital archives, the digitisation of non-digital objects (such as paper and parchment records and chapters or images in published books), and the promulgation of these resources, all require digital expertise.</p>

<p class="vac_display_field_value">What will the future know of today? Archives, as the homes for our collective memories, are in the future business. Your work will ensure that today’s digital records are accessible to the next generation of citizens, researchers and historians.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="vac_display_field_value"><br />As our Web Archive Technical Specialist, you’ll develop our preservation process for the web archive collection with the support of colleagues and will work with our supplier to deliver it as an ongoing process. You will help unlock the research potential of the collection through facilitating access to the raw data and datasets based on the collection. Working within a team dedicated to continually improving the service for users, you will be a strong advocate for using innovative technologies to solve some big, often novel, challenges in an organisation that offers great support and exceptional benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="vac_display_field_value"><br />The UK Government Web Archive at TNA</h4>
<p>Archives matter. Without records, we could not hold government to account, carry out pioneering research or learn from the past. Today’s government websites will form a crucial evidence base and a rich source of context for future generations wishing to understand the operation of the state and its relationship with citizens. In recognition of this, The National Archives runs the UK Government Web Archive, one of the largest and most-used web archives in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 15 years of its existence, the UK Government Web Archive has become a large and varied digital collection. At an approximate size of 140TB, with 5 billion objects, it presents some unique and exciting challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our supplier provides the majority of web crawling and service provision but there is plenty for our team to do. You will help us ensure that the web archive is of extremely high quality and the actual preservation of the captured content is done at Kew, after it has been transferred to us from our supplier. You will be responsible for making sure that the processes supporting this are robust, well-designed and run smoothly. In doing this, you will have the opportunity to develop your understanding of the practical applications of cloud technologies.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Institutional Memory Section of the <a href="https://www.ungm.org/Public/Notice/77410">UN Library at Geneva</a> is looking for a comprehensive, robust and integrated solution to ensure the correct management, long-term preservation of and access to the UNOG archives material.</p>
<p>To achieve this objective, the solution should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>An Archives management system (“AMS”) that will serve for the management and description of the UNOG archives and the historical archives of the League of Nations, both in paper and digital copies.</li>
<li>A Digital Preservation System (“DPS”) to provide long-term preservation to the digital copies of the League of Nations archives (15 million pages).</li>
<li>A User access Interface (“UI”) to provide public access to the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>The AMS must provide integrated support for all activities related to the management of archives, including: accessioning; metadata creation and management, according to international and UN standards; collection management; arrangement; description; publication of finding aids and declassification. The AMS must be compliant with a range of common international archival standards, including: ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), EAD, MODS, METS and Dublin Core.</p>
<p>The DPS must cover the full preservation cycle for the Archives collection, from ingest to access, within the framework of the OAIS model (ISO 14721). The system must support existing, non-proprietary standards used by the archival and digital preservation community, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bagit for Submission Information Packages;&nbsp;</li>
<li>OAI-PMH for metadata exchange;&nbsp;</li>
<li>METS as a metadata container;</li>
<li>Dublin Core and MODs for descriptive metadata; and</li>
<li>PREMIS for preservation metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>The user access interface should present, in a user-friendly way, the whole digital collection allowing users to search, browse and access or download the documents. The solution can consist of one or multiple systems that work together in a fully integrated way. The successful contractor shall be responsible for implementation, configuration and integration of systems; provision of hardware and storage (or specifications and requirements); training; post-implementation maintenance and support services.</p>
<p>The contract term is anticipated to be for a period of 3 (three) years with possibility of two consecutive oneyear extensions (3+1+1), for a total contract period of five (5) years.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">The Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) seeks to employ a Head of Good Practice and Standards to fill a new post. This is an exciting opportunity to work in a high-profile and important role, designing a new program in standards and good practice for digital preservation whilst supporting the needs of an established DPC member.</span></p>
<p>In January 2018 the DPC established a new strategic objective entitled ‘Good Practice and Standards’ identifying and developing good practice and standards that make digital preservation achievable, supporting efforts to ensure services are tightly matched to shifting requirements. This new objective requires further development to meet the requirements of DPC members. Therefore, with the support of a grant from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, we have been able to create a new post that will develop this new program based on a close engagement with a significant DPC member.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the assessment of data sensitivity in cultural organisations: an exploration of the possibilities and implications in the context of a memory institution, the National Library of Scotland.</p>
<h4><strong>Project Description</strong></h4>
<p>With support from Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the National Productivity Investment Fund (NPIF) through the Scottish Graduate School for Arts and Humanities (SGSAH), Information Studies at the University of Glasgow, in collaboration with the National Library of Scotland, seeks a highly motivated graduate to undertake Ph.D. research, to investigate the effectiveness and appropriateness of using artificial intelligence (AI) for reviewing data for diverse forms of sensitivity at the National Library of Scotland. The research will use innovative methods for handling sensitive information, focusing on compliance with legal obligations (e.g. data protection). It will also investigate broader concerns, such as cost and data ethics of incorporating AI in data handling, recommending guidelines for using AI as a component for scalable policies regarding sensitive data at the Library. Hitherto computing science has been perceived as the venue for such artificial intelligence research. The research proposed here endeavours to broaden participation to the arts and humanities and cultural organisations such as National Library of Scotland.</p>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/uni-shef-research-resource-scholarship</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>A PhD scholarship is available to undertake a project to discover the requirements of archives in South Yorkshire for web-archiving, the selective collection of ephemeral Internet content.</p>
<p>Important and unique content relevant to archival collections in South Yorkshire is increasingly published on the web in the form of personal blogs, forum content, event descriptions, and a range of social media. But such material is extremely ephemeral. We need ways to collect such material and understand the complex issues around storing and preserving it and offering public access to it. Technical solutions exist, but understanding of the issues around appraisal, collaboration, planning and enabling access are limited. Such an understanding is essential to building up-to-date collections, and to maintaining the relevance of our archives in a world where content is increasingly born digital. The aim of the PhD project is to investigate sustainable solutions to web-archiving for archives in South Yorkshire, investigating the needs of different types of archive in the region, and their users.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">A PhD Research Placement opportunity in digital preservation and long term digital collection management is available at the British Library. The opportunity will focus specifically on the role and function of virus checking within a long term digital collection management and digital preservation environment.</span></p>
<p>Computer viruses are currently an under-explored aspect of digital preservation. While there is a widespread assumption that virus checking is an essential part of any practical digital preservation implementation, particularly at ingest, there are a range of interrelated questions that have not been explored in that much detail. In hosting this PhD research placement, the British Library is keen to gain a greater insight into the types of viruses that may be found with the digital collections, a better understanding of the real issues and risks that we might need to deal with as a result, and an increased awareness of how virus checking software deals with legacy viruses and its role in the Library's processing of digital content.</p>

<p>In this new and emerging environment, where data is becoming more ubiquitous and the repositories holding it are proliferating more than ever before, the traditional skills of the curator (trusted stewardship and preservation, selection and interpretation) take on a new significance at the same time as they face challenge and change. This study seeks to map out existing and evolving Humanities data practices with particular emphasis on the changing relationship this implies between researchers and curators. The mapping exercise will inform a work stream involving data delivery services desired by Humanities scholars in respect of those data sets held by The National Archives.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">This is a rare and exciting opportunity to play a key part in an Archives packing, barcoding and storage programme, and for individuals wishing to work in archives at a paraprofessional level before, or while, undertaking professional training in archives or records management.</span></p>
<p>Since 2014 the Archives Accommodation Programme (AAP) has been considering options to improve the Parliamentary Archives’ accommodation, to support Parliament's public engagement and heritage objectives, and reduce risk to the collection. No decision has been taken about future Archives’ accommodation, but we do need to improve how we protect and manage the collection. We are also introducing (through a Transforming Archive Services project) a new web interface to the Archives catalogue, a range of new online services for users,&nbsp; and a barcode tracking system, which together will transform how we manage and monitor use of the collection; it will enable the us to implement more efficient management and retrieval, deliver customer service improvements, and collect detailed management information about collection usage which will be required to inform future decisions about collection care, digitisation priorities and future storage options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As someone who is committed to a career in archives, perhaps gained through volunteering or working in another archive, and with a determination to undertake a post-graduate archive qualification, you will provide key support to a new Pack & Track Project, which will improve the packaging and storage of the collection of 4 million unique, valuable, and sometimes fragile historic records in the Victoria Tower of the Palace of Westminster, barcode it, and enhance the catalogue.</p>
<p>You will work within project plan timescales and with archivists and collection care staff to ensure our records are adequately packaged, identifiable and trackable and that catalogue records, their references, titles/descriptions and locations match the details on the packaging and containers. The work will involve records appraisal, cataloguing, and also barcoding our collections for the first time, working intensively with CALM and a newly-procured bar coding product, to enable more automated management of storage and records production.</p>
<p>Financial support will be offered to those enrolled, or seeking to enrol on an agreed postgraduate Archives or related Information Management distance learning programme, on the condition that the successful candidate remains in post until the end of the contract. Financial support will be offered to a limit of 80% of course fees at an accredited institution, for the period of employment. Mentoring and some study leave may also be available.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">For an informal chat, please contact Catherine Hardman or Jennie Lynch on +44(0)20 7219 3074 or at archives [at] parliament.uk.</span></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Bodleian Libraries are looking for six Digital Archivists of the future through an exciting training scheme starting in April 2017.</p>
<p>Preserving the past for the benefit of the future is not just about manuscripts and printed material, digital materials are surprisingly fragile and also need to be preserved.</p>
<p>This scheme combines on-the-job training and funded postgraduate study. You will learn traditional and digital curation skills, applying these to the Libraries’ internationally important archive collections. You will be involved in processing digital materials, including archiving websites, but will also have the opportunity to work with the papers of individuals and organisations. You’ll learn everything from how to manage legal risks to using digital forensic tools. You will also work towards a prestigious postgraduate qualification in Digital Curation from Aberystwyth University.</p>
<p>Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine (STEM) and Social Sciences graduates rarely consider a career in archives and libraries, but in order to preserve the history of science and technology, organisations like the Bodleian Libraries need people with knowledge in these subject areas.</p>
<p>If you have a good grasp of digital technologies, excellent research skills and a passion for problem-solving then this might be the career for you. You don’t need experience in archives but you must have a keen interest in culture and history. You will be a graduate (ideally STEM or Social Sciences) with great communication skills, initiative and a willingness to work closely in a team.</p>
<p>This role is full-time for 2 years (one afternoon per week released for study).</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h1>Lord Kelvin Adam Smith PhD Scholarship:&nbsp;‘Counting sheep and other amazing creatures - managing animal surveillance to invigorate intelligent response to animal disease outbreaks'</h1>
<h4><a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/postgraduateresearch/scholarships/kelvinsmith/shortlistedscholarshipprojects/coalkasprojectdescriptions/digitalpreservationanimaldisease/" target="_blank">About the Project</a></h4>
<p>Contingency planning for exotic disease outbreaks has been at the top of the agendas for UK &amp; Scottish government policy makers, the livestock industry, and the public, after the animal disease outbreaks in the recent past (e.g. Foot &amp; Mouth Disease in 2001 &amp; 2007). Rapid detection and response to disease incursions is only possible if there are effective &amp; resilient disease surveillance systems with ongoing capacity to detect, assess &amp; disseminate disease intelligence. In Scotland, the responsibility for animal data collection (for surveillance purposes) is borne by a range of local government organisations and industry stakeholders. However, the purposes and procedures for data collection vary and may be fragmented across different domains, and may be hampered by limited resources in remote regions. As both the volume of data, and types of technologies employed change and grow rapidly, the sustainability of surveillance data quality, data retention schedules, and procedures for disease outbreak data and disease surveillance strategies are not completely transparent. This project aims to build forward-looking policies regarding data preservation in emergencies as well as in “peacetime” with the aim of bringing harmonisation to current practices, and to improve learning models of disease spread/control that might mitigate economic consequences of exotic and, in some cases, endemic animal diseases.</p>
