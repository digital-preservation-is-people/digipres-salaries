<p class="vac_display_field_value">What will the future know of today? Archives, as the homes for our collective memories, are in the future business. Your work will ensure that today’s digital records are accessible to the next generation of citizens, researchers and historians.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="vac_display_field_value"><br />As our Web Archive Technical Specialist, you’ll develop our preservation process for the web archive collection with the support of colleagues and will work with our supplier to deliver it as an ongoing process. You will help unlock the research potential of the collection through facilitating access to the raw data and datasets based on the collection. Working within a team dedicated to continually improving the service for users, you will be a strong advocate for using innovative technologies to solve some big, often novel, challenges in an organisation that offers great support and exceptional benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="vac_display_field_value"><br />The UK Government Web Archive at TNA</h4>
<p>Archives matter. Without records, we could not hold government to account, carry out pioneering research or learn from the past. Today’s government websites will form a crucial evidence base and a rich source of context for future generations wishing to understand the operation of the state and its relationship with citizens. In recognition of this, The National Archives runs the UK Government Web Archive, one of the largest and most-used web archives in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 15 years of its existence, the UK Government Web Archive has become a large and varied digital collection. At an approximate size of 140TB, with 5 billion objects, it presents some unique and exciting challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our supplier provides the majority of web crawling and service provision but there is plenty for our team to do. You will help us ensure that the web archive is of extremely high quality and the actual preservation of the captured content is done at Kew, after it has been transferred to us from our supplier. You will be responsible for making sure that the processes supporting this are robust, well-designed and run smoothly. In doing this, you will have the opportunity to develop your understanding of the practical applications of cloud technologies.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong style="font-size: 1.25rem;">Project Title</strong></p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the assessment of data sensitivity in cultural organisations: an exploration of the possibilities and implications in the context of a memory institution, the National Library of Scotland.</p>
<h4><strong>Project Description</strong></h4>
<p>With support from Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the National Productivity Investment Fund (NPIF) through the Scottish Graduate School for Arts and Humanities (SGSAH), Information Studies at the University of Glasgow, in collaboration with the National Library of Scotland, seeks a highly motivated graduate to undertake Ph.D. research, to investigate the effectiveness and appropriateness of using artificial intelligence (AI) for reviewing data for diverse forms of sensitivity at the National Library of Scotland. The research will use innovative methods for handling sensitive information, focusing on compliance with legal obligations (e.g. data protection). It will also investigate broader concerns, such as cost and data ethics of incorporating AI in data handling, recommending guidelines for using AI as a component for scalable policies regarding sensitive data at the Library. Hitherto computing science has been perceived as the venue for such artificial intelligence research. The research proposed here endeavours to broaden participation to the arts and humanities and cultural organisations such as National Library of Scotland.</p>

			<title>University Research Resource Scholarship: Web-archiving needs of archives in South Yorkshire</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/uni-shef-research-resource-scholarship</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>A PhD scholarship is available to undertake a project to discover the requirements of archives in South Yorkshire for web-archiving, the selective collection of ephemeral Internet content.</p>
<p>Important and unique content relevant to archival collections in South Yorkshire is increasingly published on the web in the form of personal blogs, forum content, event descriptions, and a range of social media. But such material is extremely ephemeral. We need ways to collect such material and understand the complex issues around storing and preserving it and offering public access to it. Technical solutions exist, but understanding of the issues around appraisal, collaboration, planning and enabling access are limited. Such an understanding is essential to building up-to-date collections, and to maintaining the relevance of our archives in a world where content is increasingly born digital. The aim of the PhD project is to investigate sustainable solutions to web-archiving for archives in South Yorkshire, investigating the needs of different types of archive in the region, and their users.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">A PhD Research Placement opportunity in digital preservation and long term digital collection management is available at the British Library. The opportunity will focus specifically on the role and function of virus checking within a long term digital collection management and digital preservation environment.</span></p>
<p>Computer viruses are currently an under-explored aspect of digital preservation. While there is a widespread assumption that virus checking is an essential part of any practical digital preservation implementation, particularly at ingest, there are a range of interrelated questions that have not been explored in that much detail. In hosting this PhD research placement, the British Library is keen to gain a greater insight into the types of viruses that may be found with the digital collections, a better understanding of the real issues and risks that we might need to deal with as a result, and an increased awareness of how virus checking software deals with legacy viruses and its role in the Library's processing of digital content.</p>

<p>In this new and emerging environment, where data is becoming more ubiquitous and the repositories holding it are proliferating more than ever before, the traditional skills of the curator (trusted stewardship and preservation, selection and interpretation) take on a new significance at the same time as they face challenge and change. This study seeks to map out existing and evolving Humanities data practices with particular emphasis on the changing relationship this implies between researchers and curators. The mapping exercise will inform a work stream involving data delivery services desired by Humanities scholars in respect of those data sets held by The National Archives.</p>

			<title>Vacancy for Cataloguer (Pack &amp; Track Project) (2 posts) at the Parliamentary Archives</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">This is a rare and exciting opportunity to play a key part in an Archives packing, barcoding and storage programme, and for individuals wishing to work in archives at a paraprofessional level before, or while, undertaking professional training in archives or records management.</span></p>
<p>Since 2014 the Archives Accommodation Programme (AAP) has been considering options to improve the Parliamentary Archives’ accommodation, to support Parliament's public engagement and heritage objectives, and reduce risk to the collection. No decision has been taken about future Archives’ accommodation, but we do need to improve how we protect and manage the collection. We are also introducing (through a Transforming Archive Services project) a new web interface to the Archives catalogue, a range of new online services for users,&nbsp; and a barcode tracking system, which together will transform how we manage and monitor use of the collection; it will enable the us to implement more efficient management and retrieval, deliver customer service improvements, and collect detailed management information about collection usage which will be required to inform future decisions about collection care, digitisation priorities and future storage options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As someone who is committed to a career in archives, perhaps gained through volunteering or working in another archive, and with a determination to undertake a post-graduate archive qualification, you will provide key support to a new Pack & Track Project, which will improve the packaging and storage of the collection of 4 million unique, valuable, and sometimes fragile historic records in the Victoria Tower of the Palace of Westminster, barcode it, and enhance the catalogue.</p>
<p>You will work within project plan timescales and with archivists and collection care staff to ensure our records are adequately packaged, identifiable and trackable and that catalogue records, their references, titles/descriptions and locations match the details on the packaging and containers. The work will involve records appraisal, cataloguing, and also barcoding our collections for the first time, working intensively with CALM and a newly-procured bar coding product, to enable more automated management of storage and records production.</p>
<p>Financial support will be offered to those enrolled, or seeking to enrol on an agreed postgraduate Archives or related Information Management distance learning programme, on the condition that the successful candidate remains in post until the end of the contract. Financial support will be offered to a limit of 80% of course fees at an accredited institution, for the period of employment. Mentoring and some study leave may also be available.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">For an informal chat, please contact Catherine Hardman or Jennie Lynch on +44(0)20 7219 3074 or at archives [at] parliament.uk.</span></p>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/oxford-graduate-vacancies</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Bodleian Libraries are looking for six Digital Archivists of the future through an exciting training scheme starting in April 2017.</p>
<p>Preserving the past for the benefit of the future is not just about manuscripts and printed material, digital materials are surprisingly fragile and also need to be preserved.</p>
<p>This scheme combines on-the-job training and funded postgraduate study. You will learn traditional and digital curation skills, applying these to the Libraries’ internationally important archive collections. You will be involved in processing digital materials, including archiving websites, but will also have the opportunity to work with the papers of individuals and organisations. You’ll learn everything from how to manage legal risks to using digital forensic tools. You will also work towards a prestigious postgraduate qualification in Digital Curation from Aberystwyth University.</p>
<p>Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine (STEM) and Social Sciences graduates rarely consider a career in archives and libraries, but in order to preserve the history of science and technology, organisations like the Bodleian Libraries need people with knowledge in these subject areas.</p>
<p>If you have a good grasp of digital technologies, excellent research skills and a passion for problem-solving then this might be the career for you. You don’t need experience in archives but you must have a keen interest in culture and history. You will be a graduate (ideally STEM or Social Sciences) with great communication skills, initiative and a willingness to work closely in a team.</p>
<p>This role is full-time for 2 years (one afternoon per week released for study).</p>

			<title>University of Glasgow advertises Lord Kelvin Adam Smith PhD Scholarship </title>

			<description><![CDATA[<h1>Lord Kelvin Adam Smith PhD Scholarship:&nbsp;‘Counting sheep and other amazing creatures - managing animal surveillance to invigorate intelligent response to animal disease outbreaks'</h1>
<h4><a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/postgraduateresearch/scholarships/kelvinsmith/shortlistedscholarshipprojects/coalkasprojectdescriptions/digitalpreservationanimaldisease/" target="_blank">About the Project</a></h4>
<p>Contingency planning for exotic disease outbreaks has been at the top of the agendas for UK &amp; Scottish government policy makers, the livestock industry, and the public, after the animal disease outbreaks in the recent past (e.g. Foot &amp; Mouth Disease in 2001 &amp; 2007). Rapid detection and response to disease incursions is only possible if there are effective &amp; resilient disease surveillance systems with ongoing capacity to detect, assess &amp; disseminate disease intelligence. In Scotland, the responsibility for animal data collection (for surveillance purposes) is borne by a range of local government organisations and industry stakeholders. However, the purposes and procedures for data collection vary and may be fragmented across different domains, and may be hampered by limited resources in remote regions. As both the volume of data, and types of technologies employed change and grow rapidly, the sustainability of surveillance data quality, data retention schedules, and procedures for disease outbreak data and disease surveillance strategies are not completely transparent. This project aims to build forward-looking policies regarding data preservation in emergencies as well as in “peacetime” with the aim of bringing harmonisation to current practices, and to improve learning models of disease spread/control that might mitigate economic consequences of exotic and, in some cases, endemic animal diseases.</p>
