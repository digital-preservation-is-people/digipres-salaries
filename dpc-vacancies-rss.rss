			<description><![CDATA[<p>Last week Jisc published a Contract Opportunity for a Digital Preservation Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS). This DPS will allow Jisc members and other organisations to purchase Digital Preservation Systems using a competitive, compliant, and fast process.</p>
<p>What is a DPS? In a nutshell, Jisc prequalifies Vendors using a core set of Digital Preservation System requirements. Buyers of DP systems can then run mini competitions (adding additional requirements if needs be) through the DPS to procure their Preservation System. This whole competition and award process can (potentially) be completed in a matter of weeks!</p>
<p>To be accepted on to the service Suppliers will need to meet the requirements set out in the published Request to Participate (RTP) document. The initial RTP phase should be complete by early March, at which point mini-competitions can start.</p>

			<title>CLOCKSS seeks Collections Management Consultant</title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-collections-management-consultant-clockss</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-collections-management-consultant-clockss</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>CLOCKSS seeks consultancy support to help us systematically identify, assess, and document an array of collection management challenges and to resolve these in partnership with the CLOCKSS community. These challenges were rare but are growing in frequency and number now that the archive is 15 years old, and the volume of content made available for post-disappearance access grows.</p>
<p>CLOCKSS is a dark archive which means that we do not make content accessible until a trigger event occurs. This typically involves the closure of a journal or disappearance of the publisher. After investigation, we bring content that has disappeared from the web out of the dark archive and make it bright by making it available in perpetuity under an Open Access license (<a href="https://clockss.org/triggered-content/">https://clockss.org/triggered-content/</a>).</p>
<p>This is an exciting project that will help contribute to the preservation of human knowledge for future generations. Tenacity, ingenuity, and excellent collections management skills are essential as is experience with collections management in an academic library or digital archive context. Highly desirable would be experience with policy setting and an understanding of the spectrum of scholarly publishers and research integrity issues.</p>
<p>The ability to work effectively independently and in collaboration with colleagues, the broader international CLOCKSS community, and our strategic partners is essential. This project is focused on policy setting then implementation, and so requires an individual or team able to think strategically at a high level and then follow through with attention to detail.</p>
<p>The consultant can be based in any time zone as long as you can work effectively with global colleagues who are at present primarily located in the Americas and Europe. We anticipate an effort equivalent to .5 FTE will be required in the first instance.</p>

			<title>PhD Studentship: Digital Twins: Post-Digital Books &amp; the Library-Lab</title>

			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-phd-studentship-oxford-brookes</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Are you passionate about the potential of digital technology to revolutionise the way we interact with the physical world?</p>
<p>Oxford Brookes University invites applications for 4 funded Digital Twins Doctoral Studentships, representing a strategic investment into Digital Twins technology research and facilities. This exceptional opportunity allows you to research one of four exciting Digital Twins projects across our faculties, with the guidance and mentorship of leading scholars. We are seeking talented individuals from diverse disciplinary backgrounds to join our vibrant community of researchers committed to pushing the boundaries of knowledge and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our objective is to equip you with the skills and expertise to become a leader within the field of Digital Twins. The university is investing in two groundbreaking buildings that will be equipped to facilitate Digital Twins research, offering large and complex Living Lab spaces. As a PhD student, you will have the unique opportunity to immerse yourself within these state-of-the-art spaces on campus, enriching your research experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School of Arts Digital Twins studentship seeks to explore how a studentship might investigate the making of digital surrogates, or twins, of items in Oxford Brookes Library and Special Collections, particularly the Chris Fowler Artist Book collection, with an emphasis on how sensors may be deployed within the making of twinned/surrogate publications.</p>
<p>Surrogates, to scale copies of fragile or rare publications, are sometimes used in libraries and special collections as a way to enable researchers to access books and other objects, which are otherwise difficult to handle or access, but how might these be rethought via the critical frameworks and material possibilities of post-digital publishing and artist books.</p>
<p>The project also seeks to research how we might create a satellite, or a digital sibling, of the library within the new building in Headington Hill, to host the surrogate publications produced within the studentship, but also reimagine the collections, catalyse engagement with them, and become a living laboratory for making post-digital publications – a hybrid Library-Lab space.</p>
<p>Oxford Brookes has a long history of training artists, craftspeople, and researchers in publishing skills, from its historic apprenticeships in letterpress, to its renowned publishing courses today – this studentship would serve to build upon this legacy.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p>Based in the Preservation &amp; Access Team, this post is an opportunity for a self-motivated individual with an interest in digital preservation to gain experience maintaining and developing our services in a modern and high-profile archive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preservation &amp; Access (P&amp;A) is one of four teams in the Parliamentary Archives, which is based within the House of Lords but jointly funded and a shared service with the House of Commons. The Parliamentary Archives provides innovative and expert information management, preservation, access, and outreach services enabling anyone in the world to use Parliament’s records, both now and in the future. We hold over 13km of physical records dating back to 1497, 4.7TB of born digital records and 22.1TB of digitised records.</p>
<p>This is a particularly exciting and interesting time to join the Parliamentary Archives. The Archives Relocation Programme (ARP) has agreed to relocate our collections and some associated services from our current home in the Palace of Westminster to The National Archives in Kew. The move of our physical collections and associated services is expected to take place by Summer 2025, with digital collections to follow.</p>
<p>Over the next year, the Digital Preservation team will work with Archives colleagues and ARP to ensure that Parliament’s digital collections are safeguarded throughout this move and will help to define Parliament’s requirements around access, preservation and transfer of digital records in the future.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main objective</span></strong></p>
<p>The Digital Archives Assistant works with both digital and physical records, with a strong focus on preserving and adding to our significant digital collections. They are a core member of the team and once trained, work independently on a wide range of practical tasks. This role is also a training post, and you will have excellent learning opportunities across the Parliamentary Archives and the ability to direct your own development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The post is offered on a fixed-term basis from 1 October 2023 to 30 September 2024, with possibility of extension. Reporting to the Digital Archivist, you will be supervised and mentored by colleagues with the aim of preparing you for a career in digital preservation or the wider archives and information sector. You will be supported in your career development with training and networking opportunities, as well as mentoring for future job or university applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This post is not designed for applicants who have completed a postgraduate qualification in archives/information management or similar.</p>
<p>The knowledge, skills and experience required for the post are outlined below. Each element will be assessed in the examples you provide in your application form. Should you be shortlisted these areas will be assessed in more depth at interview and, if appropriate, in a test.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Applications are invited for a&nbsp;<em>temporary</em>&nbsp;post of a Data Manager within UCD Library. The mission of UCD Library is to be a leader in enriching the student experience, to empower global engagement, and to act as an intellectual centre for the UCD community. UCD Library consists of five libraries, UCD Archives and the National Folklore Collection. UCD Library provides library and information services to UCD staff and students. UCD Archives and the National Folklore Collection at UCD house collections of national importance for use by the UCD community and external researchers. The successful candidate will be joining the Research Services Unit in a period of change. The person appointed will demonstrate an enthusiasm for the changing information landscape and the ongoing development of library services including the implementation of new processes and services. To facilitate the effective achievement of UCD Library's strategic goals and to support staff development and engagement, active and positive collaboration with colleagues across the Library will be a key feature of this role. UCD introduced a new Research Data Management (RDM) policy in 2020. The requirement for UCD researchers to manage and share research data will also increase as a result of current and emerging mandates from funding organisations. Working alongside UCD Library's existing Data Manager, this additional post, funded for a two-year period through the UCD EQUIP scheme, will involve: coordinating and maintaining existing RDM services and developing new services; liaising and collaborating with other Library units, researchers across UCD's Schools, Institutes and other research areas, other research support partners (e.g. Research IT, UCD Office of Research Ethics, UCD Research, Corporate &amp; Legal), and external users and agencies such as the HRB and SFI. This post offers great scope for an individual to provide leadership in the development of this important and evolving service area, particularly through designing and delivering new services and supports.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Archaeology Data Service (ADS) provides digital data archiving services for UK archaeology. It is based in the University of York but works closely with external partners, both in Higher Education and in the public and commercial archaeological sectors. All archived data is available Open Access and ADS funding is equally split between data deposit charges and research and consultancy, including a number of international projects. The ADS also manages the highly regarded Open Access journal, Internet Archaeology. Currently around 15 staff are employed. The Digital Archives Assistant role is envisaged as a fixed term trainee role for 3 years. It is anticipated that the post-holder will spend much of their time focussed on the archiving of the digital outputs of commercial archaeology projects, but there will be opportunities to be involved in ADS research projects. Secondments will be considered. It is expected that the post-holder will use the experience they gain in order to pursue a career in this field, or to apply ICT skills in their existing employment (if on secondment). Knowledge of the historic environment sector in the UK is desirable but NOT essential for the role.</p>

Our Graduate Trainee Digital Archivist Scheme could be your first step towards a career in 20th and 21st century archives. Preserving the past for the benefit of the future is not just about manuscripts and printed materials, digital materials are surprisingly fragile and also need to be preserved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This scheme combines on-the-job training and funded postgraduate study. You will learn traditional and digital curation skills, applying these to the Libraries’ internationally important archive collections. You will be involved in processing digital materials, including archiving websites, but will also have the opportunity to work with the archives of individuals and organisations. You will learn everything from editing XML metadata, to assessing legal risks, to using digital curation tools. You will also work towards a postgraduate qualification in Digital Information and Media Management from Aberystwyth University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are flexible, have a good grasp of digital technologies, excellent research skills, and a passion for problem-solving then this might be the career for you. You do not need experience in archives but you must have a keen interest in culture and history. You will have great communication skills, initiative, and a willingness to work closely in a team. Applications are welcome from graduates of any discipline relevant to the Libraries' 20th and 21st century archive and manuscript holdings, but are particularly encouraged from candidates with a STEM or Social Sciences background.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a training role and is offered on a full-time, fixed-term basis for 2 years beginning by 4 Sep 2023. One afternoon per week will be released for study, and you will be expected to attend two short study schools run by Aberystwyth University.</p>
<p>Please do not apply if you already have, or are currently doing, an undergraduate or postgraduate degree related to Archives Administration / Information Management / Librarianship / Museum Studies, or if you have already completed a traineeship in Archives / Heritage / Libraries, or have substantial work experience in these areas.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to push forwards operational understanding of how to preserve the nation’s digital knowledge?</p>
<p>Do you have a natural curiosity to investigate problems and understand the deeper cause?</p>
<p>We are looking for someone with good software development experience and an eye for detail, who has a natural curiosity to investigate our digital collections, understand what’s going on, and provide guidance and solutions to stakeholders across the Library.</p>
<p>The British Library's digital collection is vast and varied, with everything from digitised manuscripts and books, to born-digital personal archives, eBooks and eJournals, digital electoral registers, sound content, the UK Web Archive, and much more. In total, the collection comprises many millions of individual digital objects and millions more digital files, amounting to well over a petabyte of data.</p>
<p>One moment you might be analysing a collection as a whole to understand the scope or mitigate a preservation risk; another time you might be investigating aspecific digital file to determine why it doesn’t render. Or you might be developing some new software to support our on-going work, test a hypothesis, or validate a file. You will need to be creative, methodical, tenacious, able to work independently, and with an instinctive drive to research and investigate problems to their root cause. We work with teams across the Library and beyond, both curatorial and technical, so you will need to have good verbal and written communication skills to ensure you effectively communicate findings and guidance.</p>
<p>The successful candidate will join our team of Technical Analysts who contribute to the development, enhancement, and operational deployment of the tools, services and projects we undertake - such as our Minimum Preservation Tool, our work on emulation, or the analytical support we provide to migrating to our new digital repository system.

			<title>Vacancy for Digital Archivist at House of Commons UK Parliament </title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-digital-archivist-uk-parliament-22</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-digital-archivist-uk-parliament-22</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Based in the Preservation &amp; Access Team, this exciting role has responsibility for digital collections management, operational management of the Digital Repository, and assisting with digital preservation skills-building across the Parliamentary Archives. The role provides both professional and technical support to the whole office, helping us embed best practice in terms of how we preserve and provide access to digital archives.</p>
<p><br />The role would suit someone with strong digital and interpersonal skills, who would enjoy working in a friendly, pragmatic and user-focussed team to support Parliament’s digital preservation services. The post holder will also work closely with colleagues in the Parliamentary Digital Service to ensure the continued preservation and accessibility of Parliament’s digital records through keeping our tools and systems performant.</p>
<p><br />The Preservation &amp; Access team is made up of 14 staff, including archivists, digitisation and collections care professionals and two trainees. The Parliamentary Archives is based in the House of Lords but is a shared service jointly funded by both Houses of Parliament. It holds over 13km of physical records dating back to 1497 and its Digital Repository is growing rapidly.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Role</strong></span></h3>
<p>Reporting to the Senior Archivist (Digital Preservation), the post holder will support the delivery of a comprehensive digital preservation function for the Parliamentary Archives, in order to enable the long-term survival and continued accessibility of Parliament’s digital records. They will lead on the monitoring, reporting, and control of risks to digital records held in Parliament’s Digital&nbsp;Repository.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working with digital preservation staff and related roles in the Parliamentary Archives, they will advocate digital preservation awareness, become familiar with and communicate initiatives, standards in use or under development, and train staff to undertake basic digital preservation tasks themselves. They will provide supervision and support to Archives colleagues engaging with digital preservation work, such as ingests.</p>
<p><br />Whilst the post holder’s activities will largely be focussed on the maintenance and operation of the Digital Repository, there are other responsibilities and opportunities that will keep this role varied and challenging. These include supporting the development of ingest workflows and processes for data from new internal systems such as Microsoft Office 365, new digital projects and reprocurement exercises, and contributing to our online services provision.<br />This is a time of change for the Parliamentary Archives. The Archives Relocation Programme’s (ARP) Full Business Case has proposed that the House of Lords and the House of Commons will enter into an agreement with a partner organisation about the transfer of the Parliamentary records and the future provision of the Parliamentary Archive services.</p>
<p><br />There is no agreed date yet for the transfer, but over the next year this role will play an important role, working with Archives colleagues and ARP to ensure that Parliament’s digital collections are safeguarded throughout this move and will help to define Parliament’s requirements around access, preservation and transfer of digital records in the future.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The British Library's Digital Collection is a unique treasure trove, with everything from digitised manuscripts and books, to born-digital personal archives, eBooks and eJournals, digital electoral registers, a world of Sound content, the UK Web Archive, and much more. In total, the collection comprises many millions of individual digital objects and millions more digital files, amounting to well over a petabyte of data. All of these items require efficient management if they are to persist over time and remain reliably available into the future.</p>
<p>This post represents a rare opportunity to join the Library’s Digital Collections Management &amp; Preservation Team and help implement a new, holistic approach to managing the Library's Digital Collection. Working with the Head of Digital Collection Management, the successful candidate will work closely with colleagues from around the Library to progress the Library's new Collection Management Strategy, focusing specifically on improving and consolidating our digital collections practices. Reporting directly to the Digital Preservation Research &amp; Services Lead and managing a small team of their own, the post holder will also take responsibility for coordinating local services like the Digital Media Capture Unit and Minimum Preservation Tool to provide targeted preservation support for collections not yet ingested to our digital repository.</p>
<p>This is an exciting role with excellent potential for growth. Candidates should be able to demonstrate a keen interest in and knowledge of the Library's Digital Collections, with several years’ experience of working in a managerial capacity as well as having operational experience with digital library systems and technologies. Possessing an undergraduate degree in Library, Archives, or Information Science, or a related discipline, candidates should be able to demonstrate a sound understanding of concepts relating to digital lifecycle management, including issues and concepts relating to long term digital preservation and curation, and have an aptitude for the development of policies. Excellent people skills are a must, alongside a proven ability to work independently and a keen eye for detail. With strong writing, desktop computing and information management skills, the ideal candidate will be a confident self-starter, able to work and communicate with colleagues from a range of different disciplines and backgrounds.</p>
<p>The role is primarily based in Boston Spa, Yorkshire, though in line with Library policy there is also flexibility to work part of the week from home. There will be an opportunity for occasional travel to London, and for the right candidate, the possibility of international travel to engage with digital collection management initiatives being developed elsewhere.</p>

<p>OHOS works with the national collection of Community Generated Digital Content (CGDC). This content has been developed as communities have adopted digital technologies to gather and record their collections in a form of 'citizen history', and it is distributed throughout communities, localities, and national organisations. Currently, it is untapped, hard to find, and at risk of disappearing altogether due to technological and organisational barriers. OHOS will make this content discoverable and linkable. Our partnership includes researchers in digital humanities, archives, history, linguistics, and computer science at the Universities of Glasgow and Manchester. The National Archives (TNA) leads on digital archives infrastructure development. This team is using cutting-edge approaches from cultural heritage, humanities and computer science to dissolve barriers and add meaningful links across these collections.

			<title>Funded PhD - Evaluating Nuclear Heritage: Developing New and Practical Approaches to a Complex Industrial Landscape</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<h3>Key information</h3>
<p>A PhD project funded by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA)&nbsp;to be hosted at the University of York, jointly between the Departments of Archaeology and Physics.</p>
<p>Lead academic supervisors: Professor John Schofield (Archaeology) and Professor David Jenkins (Physics)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;This opportunity is&nbsp;<strong>only available to Home (i.e. UK) citizens</strong>. This is based on the fact that students will need to receive national security clearance both for access to sites and archives held at Nucleus, and that this clearance may be problematic for EU or International students.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closing date:&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;4th November 2022</strong></p>
<p>Applications must be submitted by midnight GMT on Friday&nbsp;4th November&nbsp;2022 to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses/apply?course=DRPARCSARC3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Application system">University's online system</a>. Interviews will be held&nbsp;on 24/25th November 2022. The studentships will ideally begin in&nbsp;January 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>For academic enquiries relating to these scholarships, please contact the supervisors (details below). For general enquiries relating to the application, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:archaeology-pg@york.ac.uk"></a><a href="mailto:archaeology-pg@york.ac.uk">archaeology-pg@york.ac.uk</a></p>
<h3><strong>Project Description</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>UK-based researchers are amongst the frontrunners in developing new understandings of contemporary industrial heritage including its values and long-term legacies. For the nuclear industry, this heritage includes: sites and buildings; items and infrastructure; documents;&nbsp;scientific and engineering developments some of which were world-leading at the time;&nbsp;and the memories of communities that often remain after decommissioning.&nbsp;This is therefore a specialised field where social- and knowledge-based values are essential to informed decision making. This innovative project will address NDA’s&nbsp;<strong>Priority Area E9</strong>&nbsp;by defining new ways to assess the heritage values of these complex and often contested places. The project will benefit from the combined expertise of specialists from archaeology/heritage and physics who have worked together previously at CERN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PhD study will: explore the various ways that heritage values can be applied to the nuclear industry; and translate this knowledge into NDA policy. The project will involve: developing&nbsp;and promoting key skills required to help NDA carry out its mission over the coming decades; and encouraging knowledge transfer between academic and industrial communities working on nuclear decommissioning; while:&nbsp;exploring the opportunity for including citizen engagement in decision making.&nbsp;Outputs from the project will include accessible and practical heritage guidelines for NDA staff alongside academic and publicly accessible outputs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How the project will support the NDA mission</strong></p>
<p>In response to&nbsp;<strong>Priority Area E9</strong>, this project has the specific aim of creating social and knowledge-based understanding to inform guidelines for future heritage decision making across the NDA Estate. As stated under E9: ‘There is a lack of research on the heritage value of the nuclear industry in the UK. There is a risk that losses may occur during decommissioning through a failure to recognise the value of what is there.’&nbsp;Building on SCHOFIELD’s prior experience in heritage policy and management related to contested and contemporary heritage, and his previous collaboration with JENKINS at CERN, the project will use a combination of site visits and archival research to&nbsp;define social and knowledge-based values that will: 1)&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;informed decisions about the future of the nuclear estate, by helping to identify which sites, buildings or infrastructure should be preserved in situ and by record and which can be adaptively reused; 2) promote and enhance public (including local) understanding of the significance of the UK’s nuclear heritage; and 3) help to establish how sustainable or publicly acceptable various decommissioning solutions might be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project aligns closely with SCHOFIELD’s previous work on the military estate where the same risks existed, that vital aspects of heritage could be considered to lack or hold negative value and, as a result, be needlessly destroyed without record. This danger is evident for NDA in the absence of any mention of heritage in its Draft Strategy in spite of growing interest across the heritage sector in: heritage futures; managing profusion; and dealing with contemporary,contested and toxic legacies. A failure to fully engage with the industry’s heritage would contradict the terms of Historic England’s (2017) Protocol for The Care of The Government Historic Estate, and specifically its requirement to ‘ensure that the significance of any heritage asset is taken into account when planning change or development’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no suggestion that everything across the NDA Estate should be retained. But, as with Cold War military sites, specific items may merit either preservation in situ or by record, or benefit from careful and adaptive re-use. Such decisions can only be taken on the basis of social and knowledge-based evaluation. While a strong foundation has been established in the form of English Heritage’s (2006)&nbsp;<a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/research/results/reports/6337/StrategyontheHistoricIndustrialEnvironmentReportEngland%27sAtomicAgeDesktopinvestigationandassessment">Strategy for England’s Atomic Age</a>, combined with the political context of Hill’s (2013) An Atomic Empire, such an evaluation has not yet been undertaken.</p>

<p>You are an enthusiastic and organised individual who is keen to join a growing team and make a positive a contribution. You have the confidence to advise and support our users as they send us increasingly complex digital records. You are delivery focused and strongly motivated to provide an excellent service. As part of the Digital Archiving team, you will directly contribute to growing the digital archive and delivering the aims of TNA’s business strategy, Archives for Everyone.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The British Library's Digital Collection is a unique treasure trove, including everything from digitised manuscripts and books to born digital personal archives, eBooks and eJournal articles, electoral registers, a world of Sound, the UK Web Archive, and more. It numbers many millions of individual digital objects and millions more digital files, amounting to well over a petabyte of data. All of these items require efficient management if they are to persist over time and remain reliably available into the future. This post represents a rare opportunity to join the newly developed Digital Collections Management team and help develop a new, holistic approach to managing the Library's Digital Collection. The successful candidate will support the Head of Digital Collections Management by coordinating implementation of the digital element of the Collection Management Strategy, working with curatorial colleagues from across the Library to ensure that our approach includes all collections, at all stages of the lifecycle. Working with colleagues from Digital Preservation and Curation, the post holder will also take responsibility for managing local services such as the Digital Media Capture Unit to ensure handheld digital acquisitions are appropriately processed and can be preserved.<br /><br />This is an exciting role with excellent potential for growth. Candidates should be able to demonstrate a keen interest in and knowledge of the Library's Digital Collections, with at least years of previous experience in a previous managerial capacity as well as operational experience with digital library systems or technologies. Possessing an undergraduate degree in Library, Archives, or Information Science, or a related discipline, candidates should be able to demonstrate sound understanding of concepts relating to digital lifecycle management, including issues and concepts relating to long term digital preservation and curation, and an aptitude for policy development. Excellent people skills are a must, alongside a proven ability to work independently and a keen eye for detail. With strong writing, desktop computing and information management skills, the ideal candidate will be a confident self-starter, able to work and communicate with colleagues from a range of different disciplines and backgrounds.<br /><br />The role is primarily based in Boston Spa, Yorkshire, though in line with Library policy there is flexibility to work part of the week from home. There will be an opportunity for occasional travel to London, and for the right candidate, the possibility of travel abroad to engage with international digital collection management initiatives.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Open only to Black and/ or Indigenous recent graduates (graduated no earlier than Spring 2021)</p>
<p>Librarianship is a predominately white profession. We know that intentional work is needed to diversify it and so the University of Toronto Libraries is dedicated to developing a cohesive approach and plan to do this. To date, we have piloted a series of programs at a variety of career stages, including opportunities for high school students and internships for Faculty of Information MI students; we anticipate that these initiatives will continue. The development of two early-career librarian opportunities is our next step forward.<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />University of Toronto equity/demographic data has shown us that we particularly lack representation from Black and/or Indigenous colleagues. These positions are therefore open only to Black and/ or Indigenous recent graduates (graduated no earlier than Spring 2021) in an intentional effort to diversify our librarian complement. These positions will provide exposure to a wide range set of opportunities, as well as targeted mentoring and coaching.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Resident for Preservation will engage in a variety of preservation initiatives for both print and digital collections. Reporting to the Digital Assets Librarian in the Digital Preservation Unit, they will support preservation in three different departments: the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, Scholars Portal, and the Collection Development Department. The experience will include preservation assessment of fragile digital content, reconciling and reporting on national digitization work, and an introduction to the steadily growing field of research data management. As part of a team, the Resident will execute preservation-related projects depending on their interests and the emerging priorities of the libraries.</p>
<p>Possible Residency projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conduct preservation assessments and produce condition reports of born-digital materials in specific manuscript collections held in the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library (e.g. Shyam Selvadurai’s recently acquired digital papers).<br aria-hidden="true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate an Association of Canadian University Presses overlap study in support of the Libraries, <a href="mailto:Keep@Downsview">Keep@Downsview</a>, the North/Nord Shared Print Network, and Scholars Portal.<br aria-hidden="true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research data management projects at Scholars Portal, including platform migrations and scoping projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to project-based work, the Resident will engage in the daily work and decision-making of the libraries through committee participation and involvement with library staff throughout the UTL system, based on the Resident’s interests, skills, and relevance to their own work and scholarly interests.</p>

			<title>Vacancy for Project Archivist at Council for British Research in the Levant</title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-project-archivist-cbrl</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-project-archivist-cbrl</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Council for British Research in the Levant (CBRL) advances public education on the Levant, promoting and disseminating research in the humanities, social sciences, and related subjects, working on and in Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and Cyprus. Our mission is to advance knowledge and understanding of the peoples and cultures of the Levant. We have two institutes in the Levant: the&nbsp;Amman Institute in Jordan and the Kenyon Institute in East Jerusalem, where our libraries are located.</p>
<p>CBRL seeks a Project Archivist to make a significant contribution to the establishing of CBRL’s digital and physical archival infrastructure, enabling greater access to our archival collections. CBRL is the inheritor of the uniquely rich archive of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (BSAJ). The centenary of the British Mandate in Palestine, and the decolonisation of knowledge production associated with it, provide the ideal context to establish the physical and digital infrastructure of CBRL’s archives. This archival infrastructure will provide a critical plank to underpin CBRL’s research strategy in the coming years, providing an essential scholarly resource on Mandate archaeology for UK and international researchers. Up-to-date archival knowledge and effective communication skills are required, and familiarity with the Levant is desirable, although not essential for someone who is eager to learn about the region.</p>
<p>The role is London based and a competitive salary of £30K pro rata, inclusive of London weighting, is offered, with USS pension.</p>
<p><b>Job Purpose and Summary</b></p>

<p>The role is London-based, and the successful candidate will be on a hybrid working policy, expected to work in the office at least two days per week, excluding periods of work travel. The role is fixed term, spanning 7 months from June-December inclusive, 4 days per week, Monday to Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Travel to the Levant region will be required for short periods, and travel to a related archival collection in East London may be needed on a semi-regular basis.</p>
<p><b>Main Duties and Responsibilities</b></p>
<p><b>Archival development, discoverability and accessibility</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Work collaboratively to develop /adopt appropriate metadata schemas for cultural heritage-, environmental- and social science-related collections, which will then be presented bilingually (English and Arabic) via an open-access digital archive website</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with Strategic Projects Director (Line Manager) and external consultant on an archival records management policy and a digital and physical records preservation policy prior to beginning digitisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute to setting multi-year digital humanities strategy for increasing the discoverability and accessibility of CBRL archival collections</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Archive appraisal, arranging, cataloguing and digitisation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Producing accurate data according to internal, national, and international standards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying sensitive data in need of further review accurately and contributing to the development of policies to guide identification and decision making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rehousing materials in preservation quality materials as appropriate</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Bodleian Libraries is looking for Digital Archivists of the future. Our Graduate Trainee Digital Archivist Scheme could be your first step towards a career in modern archives. Preserving the past for the benefit of the future is not just about manuscripts and printed material, digital materials are surprisingly fragile and also need to be preserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This scheme combines on-the-job training and funded postgraduate study. You will learn traditional and digital curation skills, applying these to the Libraries’ internationally important archive collections. You will be involved in processing digital materials, including archiving websites, but will also have the opportunity to work with the archives of individuals and organisations. You will learn everything from editing XML metadata, to assessing legal risks, to using digital curation tools. You will also work towards a postgraduate qualification in Digital Information and Media Management from Aberystwyth University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are flexible, have a good grasp of digital technologies, excellent research skills and a passion for problem-solving then this might be the career for you. You do not need experience in archives but you must have a keen interest in culture and history. You will have great communication skills, initiative and a willingness to work closely in a team. Applications are welcome from graduates of any discipline relevant to the Libraries' 20th and 21st century archive and manuscript holdings (see<a href="http:" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/subjects/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/subjects/5">https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/subjects/5</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http:" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/subjects/1221" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a><a href="https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/subjects/1221">https://archives.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/subjects/1221</a>), but are particularly encouraged from candidates with a STEM or Social Sciences background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This role is being offered on a full-time, fixed-term basis for 2 years. We are seeking to fill two roles, with one post to start by 1 April 2022, and the other by 1 Sep 2022. One afternoon per week will be released for study, and you will be expected to attend two short residential study schools at Aberystwyth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do not apply if you already have, or are currently doing, an undergraduate or postgraduate degree related to Archives Administration / Information Management / Librarianship / Museum Studies, or if you have already completed&nbsp; a traineeship in Archives / Heritage / Libraries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This role will not attract sufficient points to obtain a sponsored Tier 2 visa under the points based immigration system. Applications are welcome from candidates who don’t currently have the right to work in the UK, but who would be eligible to obtain a visa via another route.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>What will the future know of today? Archives, as the homes for our collective memories, are in the future business. Your work will ensure that today’s digital records are accessible to the next generation of citizens, researchers and historians.</p>
<p><br />Archives matter. Without records, we could not hold government to account, carry out pioneering research or learn from the past. Today’s government websites will form a crucial evidence base and a rich source of context for future generations wishing to understand the operation of the state and its relationship with citizens. In recognition of this, The National Archives runs two web archive services: the UK Government Web Archive, an enormous collection and one of the largest and most-used web archives in the world; and the EU Exit Web Archive, the official archive of EU law following the UK’s departure from the EU.</p>
<p><br />Web archiving is an exciting, specialist, varied and rapidly evolving field that is a lot of fun to be involved in. Building and maintaining excellent web archiving services calls on a range of skills: problem solving, creativity, developing new techniques for capturing and replaying content, as well as supporting research, and managing stakeholders and projects.<br />As our Web Archiving Data Analyst and Engineer, you’ll use data analyst and programming skills to gain new insights into our data, which will support the services in a number of respects including demonstrating the composition of the archives, developing and enhancing tools that we have available to capture and manage the data, and support initiatives that encourage computational research.</p>
<p><br />Working within a team dedicated to continually improving the quality of our service for users, you will be a strong advocate for using innovative technologies to solve some big, often novel, challenges in an organisation that offers great support and exceptional benefits.</p>
<p><br />This is a full time post. However, requests for part-time working, flexible working and job share will be considered, taking into account at all times the operational needs of the Department. A combination of onsite and home working is available and applicants should be able to regularly travel to our Kew site</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="vac_display_field">In the 25 years of its existence, the UK Government Web Archive has become a large and varied digital collection. At over 200TB, and 6 billion objects, it presents some unique and exciting challenges.</p>
<p class="vac_display_field"><br />As a member of the web archiving team, you will be supporting our varied work in making sure that we can understand our collections and convey this to our users in new and innovative ways, demonstrating the value of the services and the impact of our activities. You will support others’ research by delivering development that will help users explore our services “as data”. You will also contribute to the team’s tools and processes, ensuring that we can go about our work as efficiently and effectively as possible.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1743373" class="btn">FIND OUT MORE &amp; APPLY</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The University of York (UoY) and Historic England (HE) are pleased to announce the availability of a fully funded Collaborative doctoral studentship from October 2021 under the AHRC’s Collaborative Doctoral Partnership Scheme.</p>
<p>Entitled ‘Informing our Heritage Future(s): Preserving our Digital Past(s)’ this project will explore one of the most pressing challenges facing the heritage sector: the consistent capture, selection and archiving of diverse digital data sets that ensure their future accessibility and interoperability by the public and historic environment stakeholders.</p>
<p>This project will be jointly supervised by Dr Kate Giles and Kieron Niven (UoY) and David Andrews and Simon Taylor (HE) and the student will be expected to spend time at both the University of York and Historic England as well as becoming part of the wider cohort of CDP funded students across the UK. The studentship can be studied either full or part-time.</p>
<p>The project will take as its focus the historic High Street, which is currently facing a period of unprecedented change as COVID accelerates long-term trends in retail and residential demand, and as developers and local authorities seek to support the sustainable development of this heritage asset to meet key challenges of economic and environmental sustainability, housing needs, and climate change.</p>
<p>Close attention will be paid to the formats of digital data sets generated by stakeholders with particular emphasis on new developments in complex digital data sources such as laser scanning and LIDAR and the capacity and potential of data management systems such as GIS and HBIM to support better sharing, accessibility and interoperability within and between relevant stakeholders, aligning with HE’s Heritage Information Access Strategy (HIAS).</p>
<p>Details on the studentship can be found at <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/postgraduate-study/research-postgrads/pgr-fees-funding/"></a><a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/postgraduate-study/research-postgrads/pgr-fees-funding/">https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/postgraduate-study/research-postgrads/pgr-fees-funding/</a> and <a href="https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership-cdp-studentship-informing-our-heritage-future-s-preserving-our-digital-past-s/?p132280"></a><a href="https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership-cdp-studentship-informing-our-heritage-future-s-preserving-our-digital-past-s/?p132280">https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership-cdp-studentship-informing-our-heritage-future-s-preserving-our-digital-past-s/?p132280</a></p>

The MRC received Archive Service Accreditation of The National Archives in 2019.<br /><br />Following the retirement of our current Archives Manager we are looking for a qualified archivist with a Postgraduate Diploma or MA in Archive Administration and extensive experience as an archivist in a managerial or senior role, ideally in a Higher Education setting. The successful candidate will have substantial knowledge of the use and role of archives in an educational setting, knowledge of archive cataloguing and metadata schema, a good understanding of preservation processes, disaster planning and relevant health and safety standards, as well as in-depth knowledge of developments in digital archives and allied systems, software and applications.<br /><br />As the postholder will be leading the MRC team we are looking for someone with proven experience of staff management and managing small teams. As noted, there is much work to do with the NUM archives so a successful track record of project management is key. Candidates must have experience of teaching, ideally at HE-level, and a good knowledge of developments in outreach and communications (including the effective use of social media and digital assets) is essential.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><b>The Borthwick Institute</b></p>
<p>The Borthwick Institute was established in 1953 in St Anthony's Hall in York. Following an award of £4.415 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, it moved to purpose-built premises on the University campus in 2005. The Borthwick Institute is one of the largest and most important archive repositories in the North of England. The Borthwick is a public archive repository, providing public access to archives from the 11th to 21st centuries. We have a wide-ranging and demanding clientele, with equally wide- ranging research demands. We are the busiest archive in the higher education sector.</p>
<p>Within the University we:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>serve academic departments as a repository for primary research materials, including the University’s archive;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>guide students, researchers and staff in the use of those materials;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide records management services across the University;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Borthwick staff play a role in the wider archive, records management and historical sectors through membership of a range of professional bodies, from editorial positions in record-publishing societies, to advisory roles in national strategic organisations.</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong></p>
<p>All organisations produce digital records, but the methodology for retaining them in the long term is often neglected. In the context of the University and its Records Management Policy, the long-term or permanent accessibility and viability of its digital research records, as well as records produced by management and administration, are needs that particularly need to be addressed. The preservation of digital assets - and in particular the preservation of websites and online resources - are critical issues we need to address.</p>
<p>The long-term preservation of digital archives presented to the University, and the preservation of archives in analogue format that can only be retained in digital format (such as recorded sound), are also pressing needs in a University with an active archive collecting policy. In addition, the digital cataloguing of digital and non-digital archives, the digitisation of non-digital objects (such as paper and parchment records and chapters or images in published books), and preservation of and access to these resources, all require critical digital expertise.</p>

			<title>AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Partnership (CDP) Studentship: Charity and Voluntary Sector Archives at Risk: Conceptualising and Contextualising a Neglected Archives Sector</title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/ahrc-collaborative-doctoral-partnership</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>UCL and The National Archives are pleased to announce the availability of a fully funded Collaborative doctoral studentship from October 2021, under the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)&nbsp;<a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/skills/phdstudents/collaborative-doctoral-partnerships-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collaborative Doctoral Partnership Scheme</a>.</p>
<p>The project explores archives and records management practices across the UK voluntary sector. It will be jointly supervised by Dr Georgina Brewis and Professor Elizabeth Shepherd at UCL and Kathryn Preston and Tina Morton at The National Archives. The student will be expected to spend time at both UCL and The National Archives. They will also become part of the wider cohort of CDP funded students across the UK, with access to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ahrc-cdp.org/category/upcoming-training-opportunitues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDP Cohort Development events</a>.</p>
<p>The studentship can be studied either full or part-time.</p>
<p>It is important to us that our organisations are more diverse, so we encourage applications from people of all backgrounds and identities. We especially keen to hear from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds as they are currently underrepresented at this level in this area.</p>
<p>Students should have a Masters degree in a relevant subject OR be able to demonstrate equivalent experience in a professional setting, such as work in archives or the voluntary sector.</p>
<p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>
<p>The archives and records of charities and voluntary organisations constitute a neglected resource. They are sources of institutional identity and accountability, and can give access to personal and collective memories. In particular, voluntary organisations, campaigning bodies and community groups’ records preserve the histories of marginalised and disenfranchised individuals and communities whose voices can go unheard. This includes the UK’s BAME communities; LGBT+ individuals and groups; people with disabilities or ill health; as well as communities marginalised in myriad ways through poverty and other inequalities. High-profile inquiries into the history of public, corporate and charitable bodies have highlighted the evidential value of records. These archives help explain the significance of charities to society, past and present. However, without the legal protection afforded to&nbsp;government records, charity archives also lack the financial resources and support networks that protect other private archives. Records are retained by charities in varying states of preservation and access, few organisations have staff with records management/archive expertise and many collections remain invisible. Today, the voluntary sector faces the perfect storm: a major loss of income during the COVID-19 pandemic combined with unprecedented calls on organisations’ services. This is a timely and urgent project that draws on qualitative research with charity leaders to explore archives and records management practices across the voluntary sector. It will produce a practical action plan to address identified challenges, propose improvements to support infrastructure and contribute to TNA’s strategic vision for the archives sector.</p>

			<title>Vacancy for Research Data Specialist at the DCC</title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-research-data-specialist-dcc</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-research-data-specialist-dcc</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<h4>The work</h4>
<p>The research data specialist role in the DCC is one that is designed to allow people with a wide range of backgrounds, skills and pre-existing knowledge to engage in all of the DCC's areas of activity, all of which related to one or more of open science, FAIR data, research data management and reuse, and the curation of digital materials in general. The activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>international projects such as FAIR's FAIR, EOSCPilot and FAIR4Health;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consultancy for research-performing organisations, policy-makers and others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the development and delivery of training;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>events such as IDCC, RDMF and the RDA Plenaries;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the delivery of services such as DMPonline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first instance, you'll be spending about 60% of your time on the&nbsp;<a href="https://fairsfair.eu/">FAIR's FAIR</a>&nbsp;project, a H2020-funded consortium in which the DCC is playing a major role and is engaged in activity in every work package. How the rest of your time is spent in our other areas of work will depend in part on your knowledge and areas of interest, and in part on what work we have in the pipeline. Consultancy and training in particular present very varied demands depending on the client we're dealing with and the particular requirements they have. What we can guarantee is that the work is varied as are the people you'll deal with. There's lots of scope to develop your knowledge and skills working with us.</p>
<h4>About you</h4>
<p>The formal job specification, like many do, lists a big range of essential and desirable skills. It is a product of a formal process of characterising roles that doesn't always produce a clear description that potentially good candidates can identify with. I'll try instead to describe more informally what really matters to us.</p>
<p>Your previous experience could come from a wide variety of settings. It might have been in research, or supporting research, or working in some other environment where creating, reusing and/or understanding data is important. It might be in the public or private sector, in an internally-facing role or an externally-facing one. Your qualifications and experience could be in the sciences, arts, humanities, engineering, medicine or any other relevant area. You will need to have experience of data management and reuse in some setting, and to have some understanding of the broader principles of open research and the FAIR data principles. You are unlikely to be an expert in everything we do - none of us are. But you will be keen to develop and broaden your expertise while working with us and be able to demonstrate the aptitude to do so. You won't lack opportunities to do this whilst working with us.</p>
<p>You will need to be flexible, as the balance of our work changes from year to year. This is not a role for someone with a narrow research interest who wants to pursue that to the exclusion of all else.</p>
<p>Finally, although you'll sometimes have to work independently, you need to be collaborative. That applies to work within the DCC team and with the many organisations and individuals we work with around the world. Should you be selected for interview, we'll almost certainly be asking you for examples of this and about your experiences, positive and negative.</p>
<h4>The context</h4>
<p>The DCC is a consortium with staff currently based at the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Your employer will be the University of Glasgow but for most practical purposes we operate as a single team across the two organisations. Almost all our work is collaborative, with partners around the world, and we have a diverse team that reflects that international outlook. Ideally you will already have experience of working in this way, but that isn't essential. What is essential is that you can demonstrate enthusiasm for, and understanding of, what such collaborative working implies. Once the restrictions required by the COVID-19 pandemic ease you can expect the role to require a significant element of international travel. Even without the travel, the international nature of the work means you'll need to be able to work flexibly to accomodate meetings and events taking place in time zones very different from the UK's, or your own home time zone.</p>
<p>Like many people, we've all been working remotely for nearly a year now and we don't expect that to change in the immediate future. Thus we won't be expecting the successful candidate to relocate to Glasgow in the first instance and we welcome applications wherever you hail from.</p>

			<title>Vacancy for Programme Manager at The British Library</title>
			<link>https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-programme-manager-british-library</link>
			<guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.dpconline.org/news/job-vacancies/vacancy-programme-manager-british-library</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Programme Manager (Digital Library) manages two strategic programmes for the British Library: the UK Open Library programme and the Library Systems Transformation programme.</p>
<p>The first of these combines projects to enhance the Discovery experience at the British Library and provide a Research Repository Service, with our response to the AHRC’s Towards a National Collection Programme. Collectively these projects will enable a significant development in the researcher facing services provided by the British Library.</p>
<p>The Library Systems Transformation programme is an equally ambitious initiative which is delivering a new digital asset management and preservation system, will implement a new archive and manuscript cataloguing system and plan the long term future for how we manage the c. 250 million records that form our published collections.</p>
<p>Both programmes are well established and include a blend of live and pre-initiation projects.</p>
<p>The programme manager will operate between the Technology and Business teams responsible for the delivery across these programmes. They are responsible for ensuring timely delivery of all projects and managing all aspects of the programme (timeline, budget, risks etc.).</p>
<p>To succeed in this role, you will need significant project/programme management experience that should include delivering technology enabled business transformation.</p>
<p>As one of the world’s great libraries, our duty is to preserve the nation’s intellectual memory for the future and make it available to all for research, inspiration and enjoyment. At present we have well over 170 million items, in most known languages, with three million new items added every year. We have manuscripts, maps, newspapers, magazines, prints and drawings, music scores, and patents. We make our collections and programmes available to all. We operate the world’s largest document delivery service providing millions of items a year to customers all over the world. What matters to us is that we preserve the national memory and enable knowledge to be created both now and in the future by anyone, anywhere.</p>
